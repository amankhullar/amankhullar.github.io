                Hi, nice to have you here! I am a Master's in CS student at Georgia Tech, Atlanta Campus, where I am working in the intersection of NLP, ICT for development and HCI.
              </p> 


              <p style="text-align : justify">
                Previously, I worked as a Research Associate at <a href="https://gramvaani.org/">Gram Vaani</a>,
                under the inspiring guidance of <a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~aseth/">Prof. Aaditeshwar Seth</a>.<!--, at the intersection of NLP, ICT for Development and HCI.-->
                At GV, I tried to answer how to appropriately design and deploy AI (mostly speech) products in a social context to empower the under-represented people using an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) platform. 
              </p>
              <p style="text-align : justify">
                 <!-- Previously, I worked as a Research Engineer for <a href="https://tto.iiit.ac.in/">Product Labs</a> at <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">IIIT Hyderabad</a> upon graduation from <a href="http://www.nsit.ac.in/">Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology</a>.
                At IIIT I worked under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=sIvMnGQAAAAJ&hl=en"> Prof. Manish Shrivastava,</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/veera-prakash-yalla-388b311/">Prof. Prakash Yalla</a>
                and built a multi-document question-answering system. -->I have also worked in the field of multimodal text summarization and multi-document question-answering. In general, I love learning and building new things and ardently believe that we can make this world a better place with conscientious effort and great products. When I am not working,
                I am constantly exploring the answers to Life, Universe and Everything!

              Through my previous experience and projects, I have been able to work with a highly interdisciplinary team at Gram Vaani to understand the actual needs of the users and we modified our product scope accordingly (even if that meant starting from the ground-up). I also keep going back to lessons learnt under Aadi Sir's guidance by visiting <a href="http://act4d.iitd.ernet.in/act4d/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=37&Itemid=45">this</a> webpage regularly. Even at Product Labs, I observed the challenges faced in taking a product from ideation to production and then incorporating the feedback from the users. The projects I describe next are also a result of significant team effort and collaboration.

              <p>The proposed model, MMBiDAF is used for for carrying out the task of multimodal summarization
                which has been inspired from the various previous state of the art models existing in the literature. 
                This model was developed since it encompasses all the input modalities, calculates the similarity between them
                and then uses a multimodal attention layer on top of image-aware and audio-aware texts to get an output distribution 
                over the source document.</p>

                  autonomous Mars Rover and were the only college in North India to reach the top 71 teams in world. Following year we
                  qualified among top 30 teams to compete in Poland for the European Rover Challenge.</p>

              <p>
                I believe that we can be the change that we wish to bring in this world! I am working in the field of computer science
                in order to apply it to help in solving the existing problems of the world. With the widespread availability of internet, 
                the field of computer science can really exert its influence for social good.<br> Various organisations are focusing their
                work on the application of technology for Social Good and that is something that excites me and makes me believe in the 
                potential of technology when used in the right manner. <br> Moroever, I love interacting with people and listenting to 
                their disrupting ideas about how we all can work together to make this world a better place! If you share a similar philosophy
                or just want to contact me about my work, I would love to hear from you!<br>
