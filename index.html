                Hi, nice to have you here! I am currently working as a Research Associate at <a href="https://gramvaani.org/">Gram Vaani</a>,
                under the inspiring guidance of <a href="http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~aseth/">Prof. Aaditeshwar Seth</a>, at the intersection of NLP, ICT for Development and HCI.
                I am trying to answer how to appropriately design and deploy AI (mostly speech) tools in a social context to empower the under represented people using an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) platform. 
              </p>
              <p style="text-align : justify">
                Previously, I worked as a Research Engineer for <a href="https://tto.iiit.ac.in/">Product Labs</a> at <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">IIIT Hyderabad</a> upon graduation from <a href="http://www.nsit.ac.in/">Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology</a>.
                At IIIT I worked under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=sIvMnGQAAAAJ&hl=en"> Prof. Manish Shrivastava,</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/veera-prakash-yalla-388b311/">Prof. Prakash Yalla</a>
                and built a multi-document question-answering system. In general, I love learning new things and ardently believe that we can make this world a better place with conscientious effort. When I am not working,
                I am constantly exploring the answers to Life, Universe and Everything!

My work revolves around the application of computer science in real world problems and the motivation to create an end to end product for social good. I also love astronomy and have worked on a project in photometry during my undergraduate studies. I have further highlighted some of the projects that I have taken up during my undergraduate studies and would love to help anyone who is interested to know more about these projects.

              <p>The proposed model, MMBiDAF is used for for carrying out the task of multimodal summarization
                which has been inspired from the various previous state of the art models existing in the literature. 
                This model was developed since it encompasses all the input modalities, calculates the similarity between them
                and then uses a multimodal attention layer on top of image-aware and audio-aware texts to get an output distribution 
                over the source document.</p>

                <p>This algorithm solves the NP-hard problem of submodular function minimization in polynomial time. I implemented this algorithm from scratch in C++
                  to explore the field of combinatorial optimization.

                I believe that we can be the change that we wish to bring in this world! I am working in the field of computer science
                in order to apply it to help in solving the existing problems of the world. With the widespread availability of internet, 
                the field of computer science can really exert its influence for social good.<br> Various organisations are focusing their
                work on the application of technology for Social Good and that is something that excites me and makes me believe in the 
                potential of technology when used in the right manner. <br> Moroever, I love interacting with people and listenting to 
                their disrupting ideas about how we all can work together to make this world a better place! If you share a similar philosophy
                or just want to contact me about my work, I would love to hear from you!<br>
