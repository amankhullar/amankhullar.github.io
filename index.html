                Hi, nice to have you here! Inquisitive, amiable and hardworking are some adjectives used for me by the people who know me. I am 
                currently working as a Research Engineer for <a href="https://tto.iiit.ac.in/">Product Labs</a> at <a href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">IIIT Hyderabad.</a> 
                Here I am working under the guidance of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/veera-prakash-yalla-388b311/">Prof. Prakash Yalla</a> and 
                <a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=sIvMnGQAAAAJ&hl=en"> Prof. Manish Shrivastava,</a> in the field of Natrual Language Processing. 
                I am trying to develop a deep learning based document question answering algorithm which can extract answers from a large number of documents to 
                assist users with their natural language queries and avoid their manual effort of scanning hundreds of pages. Along with this I am also responsible 
                for productionizing this research to create a market-ready product.
              </p>
              <p style="text-align : justify">
                I am a 2019 graduate from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology (now known as NSUT) with a major in Information Technology where I was advised by 
                <a href="http://www.nsit.ac.in/faculty/dee/">Dr. Deepika Kukreja</a>, under whom I completed my Bachelor's Thesis Project in the field of 
                Multimodal Summarization. I was introduced to this field when I worked as a Research Intern under <a href="http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~tanmoy/"> 
                Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty</a> at IIIT Delhi where I implemented various baselines in the field of multimodal summarization. I also had a brief stint in 
                the software industry when I interned as Software Developer for <a href = "https://www.rbs.com/"> RBS </a> under 
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/himanshugoyal/">Mr. Himanshu Goyal.</a> <br><br>In general, I love learning new 
                things and ardently believe that we can make this world a better place with conscientious effort. When I am not working
                I am constantly exploring the answers to Life, Universe and Everything!

              I am interested in the fields of natural language processing, algorithmic game theory, machine learning and design and analysis of algorithms. My work revolves around the application of computer science in real world problems and the motivation to create an end to end product for social good. I also love astronomy and have worked on a project in photometry during my undergraduate studies. I have further highlighted some of the projects that I have taken up during my undergraduate studies and would love to help anyone who is interested to know more about these projects.

              <p>The proposed model, MMBiDAF is used for for carrying out the task of multimodal summarization
                which has been inspired from the various previous state of the art models existing in the literature. 
                This model was developed since it encompasses all the input modalities, calculates the similarity between them
                and then uses a multimodal attention layer on top of image-aware and audio-aware texts to get an output distribution 
                over the source document.</p>

                I believe that we can be the change that we wish to bring in this world! I am working in the field of computer science
                in order to apply it to help in solving the existing problems of the world. With the widespread availability of internet, 
                the field of computer science can really exert its influence for social good.<br> Various organisations are focusing their
                work on the application of technology for Social Good and that is something that excites me and makes me believe in the 
                potential of technology when used in the right manner. <br> Moroever, I love interacting with people and listenting to 
                their disrupting ideas about how we all can work together to make this world a better place! If you share a similar philosophy
                or just want to contact me about my work, I would love to hear from you!<br>
