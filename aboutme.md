### Hi, nice to meet you!
Inquisitive, amiable and hardworking are some adjectives used for me by the people who know me.

I am Aman Khullar, a senior undergraduate student at the Netaji Subhas University of Technology. I am majoring in the field of Information Technology. 

### Philosophy
I ardently believe that we can change the world with constant and conscientious effort.

My main motivation is to build my knowledge in the field of computer science and to benefit the people around me.

I would love to be in contact with anyone who has a similar philosophy and would like to work with me on one of my projects.

### Interests
When I am not working you can find me:
- Running in ground
- Reading a novel in my couch
- Learning about marvels of the Universe
